# Cryptography-Encoding-and-Decoding-in-EMU8086-
This project explores the field of cryptography,using the help of 8086 Microprocessor.
The EMU 8086 Simulator has been used to simulate the project

About the project
4 registers are used to take input of 4 characters from user
The same is stored to an array and read.
Encryption is undertaken by implementing an arithmetical formula.
After encryption of each alphabet,the encoded cipher text is moved to GPR registers
In order to decrypt the cipher text,it is subjected to the decryption formula,to get the original plaintext
