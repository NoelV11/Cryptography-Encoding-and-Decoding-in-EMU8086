# Cryptography-Encoding-and-Decoding-in-EMU8086-
## About the project
This project explores the field of cryptography,using the help of 8086 Microprocessor.It was a concept to implement security,along with the subject of Microprocessors

The EMU 8086 Simulator has been used to simulate the project

## Delving into the project
- 4 registers are used to take input of 4 characters from user
- The same is stored to an array and read.
- Encryption is undertaken by implementing an arithmetical formula.
- After encryption of each alphabet,the encoded cipher text is moved to GPR registers
- In order to decrypt the cipher text,it is subjected to the decryption formula,to get the original plaintext
