# Cryptography-Encoding-and-Decoding-in-EMU8086-
## About the project
This project explores the field of cryptography,using the help of 8086 Microprocessor.It was a concept to implement security,using Substitution Cipher,along with the subject of Microprocessors.

## Functionality of the Project

The user can enter a string of length 4.The EMU arithmetic library,it's operations and functions have been implemented to get the input,perform the substitution process,to encrypt the string,whose encrypted output is presented to the user.The software also offers an option to decrypt your encoded string,to recieve the original plaintext.

## Resources Used

- EMU 8086 Simulator

## Delving into the project
- 4 registers are used to take input of 4 characters from user
- The same is stored to an array and read.
- Encryption is undertaken by implementing an arithmetical formula.
- After encryption of each alphabet,the encoded cipher text is moved to GPR registers
- In order to decrypt the cipher text,it is subjected to the decryption formula,to get the original plaintext

->To run this project on your machine

- Download the EMU 8086 Simulator [from here](https://emu8086.en.lo4d.com/windows)

- Download the source files from this repository and open them from the software

- Encode and decrypt a string of length 4.Have fun playing around with the project!
